## Final Examination

### Instructions:
Create a Java program that organizes and displays creatures based on their power levels and names using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Stack.
### Problem Requirements:

1. Input Data (Fixed)
   - The program will use the following creatures and their power levels:

### Creature Name Power Level:
    - Dragon 95
    - Griffin 88
    - Unicorn 78
    - Phoenix 92
    - Centaur 85

2. Bubble Sort Implement
   -  Sort the power levels in descending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
   -  Display the sorted list.
3. Selection Sort Implementation
   - Sort the power levels in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
   - Display the sorted list.
4. Stack Implementation
   - Using bubble or selection sort, push all the creatures onto a stack data structure.
   - Then, pop all the creatures from the stack and display their details individually in the descending order of their power levels.
     
5. Add comments to explain your code.
